## **Executive Summary**

This document defines the Builder role \- a new category of individual contributor. Builders are full-spectrum operators who combine engineering excellence with product thinking, design sensibility, and go-to-market awareness to ship end-to-end solutions.

## **Role Definition**

### **What is a Builder?**

A Builder is a senior individual contributor who operates across traditional functional boundaries to deliver complete product experiences. They combine:

* **Technical Depth**: Full-stack engineering capabilities with modern tooling expertise  
* **Product Sense**: Ability to identify opportunities, define specs, and validate assumptions  
* **Design Thinking**: User experience sensibility and interface design capabilities  
* **Business Sense**: Understanding of go-to-market, customer needs, and strategic context  
* **Customer Obsession**: Deep empathy for users, direct customer engagement, and continuous feedback loops  
* **Shipping Excellence**: Ability to create MVPs and deliver production-ready features end-to-end  
* **Bonus: Growth Expertise**: Marketing knowledge and ability to deploy growth tactics independently or with GTM teams

### **Core Responsibilities**

* Own product initiatives from insight to impact  
* Write production code across the full stack  
* Design and validate user experiences  
* Define product requirements and success metrics  
* Collaborate with go-to-market teams on launches  
* Talk directly to customers for feedback and validation  
* Make autonomous decisions within strategic guardrails  
* Remove dependencies and organizational friction

## **Strategic Advantage**

### **Why This Role Matters Now**

**Industry Context:**

* The rise of AI-powered development tools is commoditizing pure coding  
* Solo founders and indie hackers are shipping products that compete with venture-backed teams  
* The most valuable contributors are those who can orchestrate tools, not just use them  
* Attract and hiring these builders before they become founders, can give a competitive advantage and bring the entrepreneurial high-agency culture within the organization  
* Cross-functional agility is becoming the primary competitive advantage

**Specific Advantages:**

1. **Velocity Multiplication**: Builders can work as effectively as traditional cross-functional teams (engineers, designers, PMMs) by combining multiple skill sets in one person  
2. **Reduced Coordination Overhead**: Fewer handoffs, meetings, and alignment sessions due to their autonomous nature and end-to-end ownership model  
3. **Market Responsiveness**: Direct customer feedback loops enable rapid iteration cycles and immediate validation of user needs  
4. **Innovation Catalyst**: Builders proactively identify emerging market trends and build solutions ahead of the curve  
5. **Cultural Leadership**: Positions your company as defining the future of product development

### **Competitive Differentiation**

By formally defining and investing in the Builder role, the company can:

* Attract top-tier entrepreneurial talent who might otherwise start their own companies  
* Set industry standards for what modern product development looks like, similar to our AI adoption initiatives  
* Ship projects with fewer handoffs and coordination overhead  
* Create a talent pipeline that aligns with where the industry is heading  
* Cultivate a culture that empowers existing engineers to develop product thinking and product managers to strengthen technical skills

## **What Makes Builders Unique**

### **Behavioral Characteristics**

* **Autonomous**: Self-directed within a collaborative environment  
* **Curious**: Constantly learning across disciplines  
* **Pragmatic**: Balances perfection with shipping velocity  
* **Collaborative**: Works effectively across all functions  
* **Strategic**: Understands broader business context  
* **Decisive**: Makes quick decisions with incomplete information

### **Behavioral Anti-Patterns (Red flags)**

* **Perfectionist**: Prevents shipping by focusing on perfection over progress  
* **Siloed thinking**: "Not my job" attitude that refuses to work across boundaries  
* **Over-Engineer**: Builds complex solutions without user validation  
* **Poor Communicator**: Struggles to collaborate effectively across functions  
* **Inflexible**: Unable to pivot from projects without impact  
* **Defiant**: Resists leadership and authority, building what they think is best regardless of leadership guidance and pushback

## **Where Builders fit in the org chart** 

### **As an Oportunistic Team Founder**

* Builds out a surface area as a solo founder of a team, focused on a specific goal  
* Clearly defined success for the “team” means surface area will get deprecated/EOL if not successful on defined timeline  
* If successful, either folds into a larger team or staffs up a team around this surface area.  
* Has ownership of new product features outcomes, and collaborates with other departments for GTM strategies, and executions/launch plans  
* Directly engages customers and iterates based on feedback  
* Act as a planet surrounded by satellites, this Builder augments all individual satellites, marketers, engineers, designers to achieve the goal.

### **As a Team Satellite**

* Embeds within an existing product team but maintains autonomy for exploration  
* Participates in team rituals while independently pursuing high-potential opportunities  
* Acts as the team's innovation engine for rapid prototyping and experimentation  
* Identifies and ships adjacent features, integrations, or workflow improvements  
* Validates ideas directly with customers without disrupting core team velocity  
* Allows teams to systematically explore the frontier while maintaining focus on primary roadmap  
* Operates as overflow engineering capacity for team in crunch times

### **New processes you'd need**

* Include Builders early enough in strategic discussions; that way they are more able to self-identify the most impactful problems to address for the business  
* Shift the mental model from coordination-heavy to outcome-driven  
* Reward calculated risks and rapid iteration over coordination bottlenecks  
* Managers should protect Builder autonomy even when it challenges existing norms  
* Builder PRD process for submitting ideas to a ***single*** identified approver, who has to read and give a thumbsup before shipping code to users.   
* Milestone checkpoint review for 28 days post launch to measure impact/discuss potential rollback/followups.    
* Company strategy sync ups, to ensure the company strategy is up-to-date and fully understood by all Builders  
* Demo Builder awareness process to keep the org up-to-date on what’s being/been shipped (could be posting weekly demos \+ someone watching/flagging/filtering important demos for larger audience)   
* Budget for tools and experimentation (easier procurement)  
* Clear escalation paths for blockers

### **Management Structure (Direct Report):**

* Ideally managed by leaders with both product and technical experience  
* Could report to VPs of Engineering, Product, or Innovation or to a manager within a team   
* Need managers who understand and protect their autonomy

## **Risks and Guard Rails**

### **Role Confusion**

**Risk:**  
Builders operate across engineering, product, design, and go-to-market functions, which can lead to unclear ownership, duplicated work, and misaligned expectations.

**Guard rails:**

* Frequent communication between builders and involved stakeholders  
* Clear definitions of their intention while working on a project

### **Erosion of Accountability**

**Risk:**

* Due to autonomy and fast-moving style, Builders may ship MVPs without defining success, long-term ownership, or clear post-launch maintenance plans, resulting in orphaned features or hidden tech debt.

**Guard rails:**

* Include a success criteria and metrics before launch.  
* Conduct quarterly Builder project reviews to assess health, ROI, and follow-through needs.

### **Conflict with Product Owners**

**Risk:**

* Builders may bypass or contradict PM direction by independently defining specs, leading to tensions around product ownership, roadmap coherence, and stakeholder communication.

**Guard rails:**

* Define and communicate a clear escalation path for roadmap conflicts  
* Schedule syncs between Builders and Product Owners to stay aligned.

### **Misalignment with Strategic Priorities**

**Risk:**  
Builders may chase exciting or emergent ideas that aren’t aligned with company OKRs, resulting in wasted effort and a loss of focus on the highest priorities.

**Guard rails:**

* Builder PRD process for submitting ideas to a single identified approver, who has to read and give a thumbsup before shipping code to users.  
* Provide Builders with direct access to company strategy and business roadmap.
